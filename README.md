## **Tech Stack**

-   **Backend**: Laravel 8
-   **Frontend**: Vue 2 with Vuetify for UI
-   **State Management**: Vuex
-   **Routing**: Vue Router
-   **API Security**: Laravel Sanctum

## **Implementations**

-   **SPA with Laravel Sanctum API**: Built Vue.js SPA connected to a Laravel Sanctum API backend for secure authentication and data handling.
-   **Vuetify for UI and Responsive Design**: Built with Vuetify to create UI components like curriculums and tables, ensuring a clean and responsive design for all devices.
-   **State Management in Vue**: Implemented state management using Vuex, allowing centralized management of application state.
-   **Role Permissions**:
    -   Students, Instructors, and Admins have distinct access levels.
-   **Laravel Eloquent Polymorphic Relationship for Course Lecture Types**: Implemented in Laravel Eloquent that links various lecture content types (video, audio, document, text) to a course lecture.
-   **API Protection with Middlewares**: Secured the API using Laravel Auth middlewares and implemented custom middleware such as `IsSubscribed` to ensure users have an active subscription and `IsCourseOwner` to verify course ownership before allowing access to specific routes.
-   **Laravel Sanctum Session-Based Authentication**: Using Laravel Sanctum's session-based cookie authentication, which provides CSRF protection and secures credentials against XSS attacks.

-   **Eloquent Events for Relationship Models**: I used Laravel Eloquent events to handle updates and deletions of related models, ensuring the integrity and proper management of relationships.

-   **PayPal Integration**: Integrated PayPal using its sandbox environment for testing payments, allowing users to make secure transactions for courses within the application.

## Challenges

-   **State Management in Vue**: Managing the application's state efficiently with Vuex.
-   **Responsive UI**: Ensuring that the user interface works well across different screen sizes and devices.
-   **Optimized Eloquent Relationships**: Improving database queries and relationships in Laravel's Eloquent ORM for better performance.
-   **PayPal Integration**: Integrating PayPal for payment processing, including handling transactions and testing with the sandbox environment.
